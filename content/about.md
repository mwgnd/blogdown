Hello World!

This is just a personal blog of mine to share my journey in learning R,where i a am going to post my code snippets, documentation and other R related stuff. I studied social sciences with a focus on computational social science and data analysis. 
I have been using R for quite a while now (still beginner) and I am still learning new things every day like building this blog with [**blogdown**](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/). I hope you will find this blog helpful.


This blog aims to share code through R-bloggers, a platform for R users to exchange content and communicate.If you find this blog by other means, I encourage you to check out R-Bloggers and subscribing to their daily feed at [R-Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/).
